Director John Glen (making his fourth Bond, after second-unit and editing work on others) should have known better, and departed the scene along with Dalton after Licence to Kill. Although adapted from an Ian Fleming story, the plot is merely an excuse for a little globetrotting, as Bond tries to help Jeroen Krabbé's Soviet general to defect. Maryam D'Abo's Czech cellist and Joe Don Baker's arms dealer don't help much, either.~false~23/09/2010~18:25~21:00~155

This is the first and best outing for Eastwood's San Francisco police inspector, in which he tramples on the American Constitution to bring gibbering psycho Andrew Robinson to justice. Directed by Don Siegel with his usual toughness and crisp efficiency, this is a masterpiece of action movie-making. Eastwood displays all the characteristic hard-boiled traits that are now part of his screen persona and cinema folklore. Making good use of Golden Gate locations, and armed with a smart and darkly cynical script, this original generates an excitement that none of the four sequels could match.~false~23/09/2010~21:00~23:10~130

Some stateside critics were quick to brand the film racist, as Michael Douglas's white-collar worker snaps one day, abandons his car in gridlock and engages in a violent spree that sees him destroy a Korean store and take on a Latino gang. But Douglas is no racist vigilante. In director Joel Schumacher's bold, believable and darkly funny film, he is a man consumed by rage at his own powerlessness, who reacts with violence to anyone who tries to prevent him from reaching "home" - now more of a concept than a place. The film loses momentum towards the end, but Douglas gives a superb performance and he's matched by the excellent Robert Duvall as an ageing, world-weary cop tackling his last case before retirement.~false~23/09/2010~23:10~01:25~135

Still nobody believes the kid's possessed Action Man story - until two seconds before they're brutally murdered, of course - resulting in a predictable, mean-spirited rehash of the original concept. A few neat touches lighten the load: Chucky burying his plush replacement in the garden with a seaside spade, for example, or a Shining-inspired climax set in an eerily designed toy factory. However, director John Lafia (who co-wrote the original) is never able to disguise the fact that his derivative valley of the dolls is beyond all hope.~false~25/09/2010~23:00~00:40~100

And, although viewers will miss the marvellous slapstick slobbishness of the late John Belushi, it's still a lot of fun. The wafer-thin plot has Elwood Blues (Aykroyd) hooking up with the band's former musicians. But the movie's raison d'être are the irresistible R 'n' B numbers performed by Aykroyd, his co-star John Goodman and dynamic vocalists such as Aretha Franklin, BB King and James Brown.

Submerged in this chaos is alcoholic former activist-turned-bureaucrat Theo Faron (Clive Owen), who watches in despair from the sidelines until a surprise visit from an ex-lover (Julianne Moore) offers him an unlikely glimmer of hope. Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón (Y Tu Mamá También) here delivers a truly startling take on PD James's downbeat novel, reworking its apocalyptic theme through the cracked prism of the post-9/11 era. Owen is excellent and there's a glorious turn from Michael Caine as an ageing, pot-smoking ex-political cartoonist. But it's Cuarón's film: his hand-held camerawork apeing news broadcasts as it records nerve-shredding action set pieces in tense, unbroken shots. True, the proceedings are occasionally marred by a surfeit of plot exposition, yet the stark triumph of Children of Men lies in how its visceral vérité style brings the realities of a War on Terror fought in distant lands crashing back onto British soil.~false~27/09/2010~21:00~23:10~130

Despite the setting being transferred to California, superior special effects heightening the nastiness (Kirstie Alley's hard-to-watch self-autopsy) and Christopher Reeve giving a nicely heroic performance (the film was released in the States just prior to his tragic riding accident), the end result forgoes the touches and stylish atmosphere you might expect from Carpenter.

Heath Ledger gives a growling performance as Kelly, while the oppressive nature of the world in which he lived is evocatively presented. Misjudged and set up by the police, especially Superintendent Hare (Geoffrey Rush), he is forced to go on the run and form a gang. The outback is filmed in tones as sumptuous as any tourist brochure, but, in the end, the idolisation of Kelly rings only as true as the stature accorded to Billy the Kid.~true~28/09/2010~21:00~23:15~135

A rescue team, led by Laurence Fishburne, is sent to retrieve it, but it soon becomes apparent that it's in the grip of a malevolent force. Fishburne, Sam Neill, Joely Richardson and Sean Pertwee bring some class to the determinedly B-movie dialogue, and Anderson delivers some eye-poppingly nasty sequences that will please horror fans.~false~28/09/2010~23:15~01:10~115

In both a tribute to and a spoof of 1950s B-movies, Burton stumbles as many times as he succeeds in playing with the back catalogue of lurid pulp sci-fi references. But once the computer-generated bug-eyed Martians arrive and strut their evil stuff, this daffy Independence Day lampoon comes alive.

Despite the setting being transferred to California, superior special effects heightening the nastiness (Kirstie Alley's hard-to-watch self-autopsy) and Christopher Reeve giving a nicely heroic performance (the film was released in the States just prior to his tragic riding accident), the end result forgoes the touches and stylish atmosphere you might expect from Carpenter.

Alec Baldwin plays the crooked national security man who's determined to hunt them down.

Misjudged and set up by the police, especially Superintendent Hare (Geoffrey Rush), he is forced to go on the run and form a gang.

And, although viewers will miss the marvellous slapstick slobbishness of the late John Belushi, it's still a lot of fun. The wafer-thin plot has Elwood Blues (Aykroyd) hooking up with the band's former musicians. But the movie's raison d'être are the irresistible R 'n' B numbers performed by Aykroyd, his co-star John Goodman and dynamic vocalists such as Aretha Franklin, BB King and James Brown. It's definitely worth catching if you can forgive Landis's self-indulgent touches, which include the biggest car pile-up ever caught on celluloid.~false~02/10/2010~17:30~19:55~145

In both a tribute to and a spoof of 1950s B-movies, Burton stumbles as many times as he succeeds in playing with the back catalogue of lurid pulp sci-fi references. But once the computer-generated bug-eyed Martians arrive and strut their evil stuff, this daffy Independence Day lampoon comes alive. Among an amazing roster of stars, Pierce Brosnan is hilarious as a presidential adviser and Lisa Marie is weirdly creepy as a disguised alien temptress.~false~02/10/2010~19:55~22:00~125

Jean-Claude Van Damme is a futuristic mercenary hired to escort a cyborg carrying the antidote to a deadly plague that has almost wiped out mankind in the 21st century. On the journey they fall foul of the Flesh Pirates, torturers, flashbacks and crucifixion as genre master Pyun piles on the trash, panache and gratuitous violence with cut-price style.~false~02/10/2010~22:00~23:50~110

Submerged in this chaos is alcoholic former activist-turned-bureaucrat Theo Faron (Clive Owen), who watches in despair from the sidelines until a surprise visit from an ex-lover (Julianne Moore) offers him an unlikely glimmer of hope. Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón (Y Tu Mamá También) here delivers a truly startling take on PD James's downbeat novel, reworking its apocalyptic theme through the cracked prism of the post-9/11 era. Owen is excellent and there's a glorious turn from Michael Caine as an ageing, pot-smoking ex-political cartoonist. But it's Cuarón's film: his hand-held camerawork apeing news broadcasts as it records nerve-shredding action set pieces in tense, unbroken shots. True, the proceedings are occasionally marred by a surfeit of plot exposition, yet the stark triumph of Children of Men lies in how its visceral vérité style brings the realities of a War on Terror fought in distant lands crashing back onto British soil.~false~02/10/2010~23:50~01:55~125

However, director Delbert Mann does a fine job of adapting Erich Maria Remarque's harrowing study of life in the trenches. In addition to winning Emmys for its editing and special effects, this sprawling TV movie also brought nominations for Mann, Patricia Neal and Ernest Borgnine, here cast as the wizened veteran who puts Richard Thomas and his fellow recruits through their paces. While it lacks the immediacy of the 1930 version, this is still a compelling and affecting insight into the hellishness of war.~false~03/10/2010~11:45~14:25~160

It is here that the film finds its conviction, in the form of dogfight sequences that succeed in being both thrilling and horrifying. Back at base, however, where young and eager First World War flier Peter Firth gradually comes to understand the cynicism of his superior, Malcolm McDowell, events are not as well realised. Moments of emotional isolation work well, but a visit to a brothel is simply trite. Still, the film generally soars.~false~03/10/2010~14:25~16:45~140

However, while there's nothing new in this Red Planet space opera (mostly lifted from 2001: a Space Odyssey and Close Encounters of the Third Kind) the Carrie director covers its drawbacks with pristine craftsmanship, trademark suspense sequences and a full quota of sharp computer visuals. The age-old question "Is there life on Mars?" is answered by Nasa astronauts Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins when they embark on a rescue mission to the planet and make an extraordinary discovery. It may be rather overcooked, but De Palma's outer-space adventure is still very watchable.~false~03/10/2010~16:45~19:00~135

So off she goes to Mexico with "uncle" Ben Cross for a human DNA transfusion (from a crazy prostitute, naturally!) in the hope it will stop her libidinous slaughter episodes. It doesn't. In his defence, director Nick Lyon strips the plot - and Mattsson - to the barest of essentials to keep things vaguely slimy, sleazy or sexy in this straight-to-DVD pot-boiler. But it's a tall order in this hodgepodge of alien nuns on the run, threadbare HR Giger rubber suits and hissy-fit hybrid cat-fights.

Named after the area of space around a black hole beyond which matter seemingly disappears, the Event Horizon here is an experimental spacecraft that has been missing for years but has just reappeared off Neptune. A rescue team, led by Laurence Fishburne, is sent to retrieve it, but it soon becomes apparent that it's in the grip of a malevolent force. Fishburne, Sam Neill, Joely Richardson and Sean Pertwee bring some class to the determinedly B-movie dialogue, and Anderson delivers some eye-poppingly nasty sequences that will please horror fans.~false~04/10/2010~00:45~02:40~115

A two-wheel Fast and the Furious, this pokes as much fun at the "choppers and chicks" genre as it does at itself. The improbable tale has ace biker Martin Henderson returning from Thailand to clear his name of drug-smuggling charges, only to be framed for murder. The script is dumb and the acting dumber, with everyone shouting or snarling lines that all seem to end with "bitch!", but it doesn't matter. Kahn knows his audience wants to see mega-octane thrills and pumped-up spills and he doesn't disappoint. The road rage face-offs are amazing, the bike chase atop and inside a moving train is astonishing and the final pursuit through the streets of LA reaches video-game levels of excitement. This is a greased-lightning adrenalin rush that works best if you don't take it too seriously.~false~04/10/2010~21:00~22:45~105

In a tiresome, violent tale involving a kidnapping, San Francisco becomes a shooting gallery in which the characters are set up simply to be shot down. Only Harry's new partner (played with spirit by a pre-Cagney & Lacey Tyne Daly) has any depth, but this intriguing relationship is wasted in a welter of sexist one-liners.~false~04/10/2010~22:45~00:50~125

This time around Gibson finds himself a reluctant surrogate father to a lost tribe of youngsters, as well as getting mixed up with gladiatorial battles in the thunderdome of the wild city of Bartertown, ruled over by the extraordinary Tina Turner. Directors George Miller and George Ogilvie stage some exhilarating set pieces and keep the action bustling along nicely, even if there are also some daft dollops of new ageism that tend to hold up the proceedings. Gibson is effortlessly charismatic in the lead role, but you can't escape the feeling that, at this late stage in the saga, he just isn't mad enough any more.~false~05/10/2010~00:50~02:45~115

Yet, in every other respect, it's a splendid adventure that scales down the gadgetry and spectacle, but still boasts some of the slickest set pieces of the entire series (courtesy of second-unit director, John Glen). And by sticking closely to the Ian Fleming novel, Richard Maibaum's screenplay gives 007 a greater psychological depth that makes both his vigilante pursuit of Telly Savalas's Blofeld and his romance with Diana Rigg's feisty contessa wholly credible. There's a terrific John Barry score, too, and the incomparable Louis Armstrong sings We Have All the Time in the World.~false~06/10/2010~19:10~22:00~170

Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are a sort of "Simple and Simpler", an endearingly goofy pair of handymen who discover that huge underground worms have broken through the Earth's surface and are now swallowing up everything in their path. Director Ron Underwood keeps both the action and laughs roaring along at a tremendous pace and there are a number of entertaining cameos, most notably from Michael Gross - the father in TV's Family Ties - and country star Reba McEntire as an unlikely pair of survivalists. Add to that a refreshingly tough and intelligent female lead (Finn Carter) and the result is the sharpest and funniest monster movie in years.~false~06/10/2010~23:15~01:15~120
