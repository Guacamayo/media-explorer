A convicted paedophile is determined to confess to killing the boy, but his story doesn't hang together, prompting Sandra and her old geezers at Ucos to look more closely at the original file on the disappearance. The child's activist parents are now divorced and dad (Kevin R McNally) has turned into an obnoxiously proselytising anti-feminist university lecturer who actually uses the word 'feminazi'. His ex-wife, meanwhile (Samantha Bond), continues to rail against the police state, prompting the ever-enlightened Gerry (Dennis Waterman) to remark with his customary asperity: 'typical bloody Lefty'. It's the usual tapestry of stock characters and absurdity, as the Tricksters' professional lives leak into their domestic circumstances. Thus paranoid Brian (Alun Armstrong) thinks that he's being bugged by the security services because of his blameless wife Esther's mild civic agitation. Totally silly, but made bearable by Armstrong's lovability.               Radio Times reviewer - Alison Graham~true~24/09/2010~21:00~22:00~60

With every plot twist telegraphed well in advance, the best thing to do is sit back and stoically tick off each plodding spooky cliché as it appears. Complete with Dorff emanating badness from scene one and his trailer-trash girlfriend (Juliette Lewis) and her inscrutable sheriff sister (Dana Eskelson) refusing to believe the patently obvious, nothing makes sense in this technically proficient but bogus horror. More hilarious than creepy - Dorff infesting the house with poisonous snakes is embarrassingly overacted - think cold, creaky mannerisms instead.~false~24/09/2010~23:15~01:10~115

Walk on the Wild Side~2, series 2~~~~~false~false~false~true~true~false~false~false~~~Comedy~The equation here is that wildlife footage plus comedy voiceover equals laughs. Not multi-layered, clever laughs, obviously. More the kind where you can't quite believe you're sniggering at something so daft. But you do. A monkey sitting on a branch miaowing like a cat, for instance. Or two birds talking at the same time about their holidays, until their friend backs away nervously. Or a beetle with its foot stuck in a dung ball desperately trying to attract its friend's attention. It's YouTube-clip comedy - a farting eagle, a chimp stuffing fruit in its mouth, goats blowing raspberries. And if you don't love it, then your kids surely will.

In 99 per cent of the scenes Gauis appears in, his role is to be sombre and/or disapproving under that straggly white wig. The characteristic Wilson look - a sort of lopsided glower with one eyebrow raised way above the other - gets free rein, but that's about it. Not tonight. After the high drama of the first two episodes, this week we get a dose of rollicking low comedy, featuring a mischievous Gaius centre stage, behaving like a man possessed. When I say low comedy I mean fart gags, donkey ears, King Uther turning bald (he looks like a medieval Mitchell brother) and Gaius taking the term 'slaphead' literally. It's all very enjoyable and makes you wish the series let its hair down, as it were, more often. Plus, we see more of another underused character as the demure Gwen steps out of the shadows to help Merlin put the world to rights.

Officially designated a Clinical Decisions Unit, it's generally known among the staff as the Can't Decide Unit because really it's just a holding zone so that patients who can't be discharged can still be moved out of the ED within two hours. Unfortunately for Mads and Yuki, who inexplicably have been put in charge, it doesn't stay neat and clean for long: a nameless man vomits blood all over the floor and a homeless woman takes off her home-made shoes to reveal something truly stomach-turning living in them. Meanwhile in 'Resus' a young man who's just returned from Pakistan (and has, according to his mate, 'been Allah-ed') is brought in with a stab wound and Ruth gets disappointed by her husband - again.

Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow~2/6, series 2~Sunderland~~Paul Wheeler~~false~false~false~true~true~false~false~false~~~Comedy~McIntyre leaps on to the stage as he always does, as if he's bouncing on an invisible pogo stick, to entrance the audience at Sunderland's Empire Theatre with a routine about murderer Raoul Moat. Risky, or so you would think, as it's surely all still a bit too raw and close to home. But this is McIntyre, so it isn't monstrously tasteless. Rather, he has fun with former soccer star Paul Gascoigne's bizarre walk-on part in the drama, when he turned up at Moat's denouement clutching sandwiches and a fishing rod. Perhaps other North East personalities should have done the same, ponders McIntyre, and arrived at the crime scene clutching snacks and pastimes. It works, once you've allowed yourself an initial, sharp intake of breath. It's a good bill, headlined by the rather sweet Sarah Millican, with her self-deprecation and observations about bras and dress-sizes.

The church was a significant place of pilgrimage 700 years ago, so appropriate, perhaps, that one of the most intriguing (and valuable) objects on show is a devotional painting of the birth and crucifixion of Christ. The seductive appeal of the programme is evenly weighted between having your own stab at the value and observing the reaction of the owner. The retired priest who still worships in front of this beautiful artefact doesn't disappoint, but his joy is almost wholly confined to discovering more about the painting, not the price tag placed on it. From the sublime, to the gruesome... the son of a chemist shows off a couple of ornate jars that were used to keep leeches in, while an insignificant looking ring reveals its own secret - a lock of hair from Napoleon Bonaparte.

Sexist attitudes were the norm, and coppers could rough up suspects without question. This is the world of George Gently - miles away from the retro cosiness of Heartbeat yet nowhere near the abrasiveness of Ashes to Ashes. Martin Shaw returns with a slightly uncomfortable London accent and a battery of wry smiles and twinkling glances to play the eponymous inspector who, in the first of two feature-length episodes, investigates both a murder and a family damaged by disturbing events in the past. The case is especially difficult for Gently's sidekick DS John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby) because he's just split from his own wife and daughter. It's an ugly story with an alarming number of twists. Just as you reckon you've got it worked out, it takes you down another avenue. However, it's strung out a teeny bit too much to keep our attention fully.

At her sparsely attended funeral in a picturesque country church, her boss Sir Harry (super Peter Firth) is in reflective mood. What's it all for, he wonders. "Ros gave everything for this country and six people came to say goodbye to her... six people." It's an uncharacteristically low-key, even solemn start to a whole new set of adventures, but fear not, this introspection doesn't last for long because once again al-Qaeda must be stopped before they blow the heart out of Britain. Lucas (Richard Armitage) is tasked with killing the leader of the group charged with carrying out the atrocity aboard a ship in mid-ocean. But before Lucas can act, his plans are thrown into turmoil by the arrival of a clutch of Somali pirates. It's a tremendous yarn, packed with gung-ho excitement and terrific amounts of derring-do. Probably it doesn't stand up to too much "would this happen in real life?" scrutiny, but what the heck, no one does high-octane adventure like Spooks.

But the meat of the film, the drama, written by Caleb Ranson and Matthew Whiteman, is excellent, too. There's very little cheery tally-ho heroism. Instead the 92 Squadron into which the 18-year-old "Boy" Wellum (Sam Heughan) arrives is brutal, world-weary and infused with hostile machismo. It's a believable and often moving portrait of a much-mythologised world.  Radio Times reviewer - David Butcher~true~27/09/2010~02:40~04:00~80

That's not to say it's better, just that it's a thoughtful, slow-burn BBC2-kind of storytelling that brings a skilled hand to the tale of a surly secondary school pupil and the maths teacher who tries to connect with him. The circumstances are beautifully sketched and horribly convincing. Within moments of meeting the troubled child's self-centred mum we sense where his problems lie. And the situation at the school - head hoping to partner with a swish local academy, new teacher struggling against the classroom backchat - is deftly played. Implicit in the title is a sense of doom about where the plot will lead, but the drama has the assurance of a long-running series - it's subtle, touching and feels as though it could be unfolding right now at a school near you.

Written by Frost from his own non-fiction book, the film examines a key moment in the history of American golf. In 1913, a working-class youngster, Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf), competed against British great Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) who, along with other English professionals, had dominated the game for years. Although Paxton and Frost sidestep the more obvious "plucky Yanks, nasty Brits" clichés, some of the supporting characters are little more than caricatures, and the fact that both Ouimet and Vardon were regarded as outsiders by their respective establishments is never really explored.~false~28/09/2010~23:35~01:35~120

French Film~~~2008~Jackie Oudney~Sophie*Anne-Marie Duff|Jed Winter*Hugh Bonneville|Marcus*Douglas Henshall|Thierry Grimandi*Eric Cantona|Cheryl*Victoria Hamilton|Alain*Jean Dell|Bowler*Adrian Annis|Waiter*Henry Maynard~true~true~false~true~true~false~false~false~3~15~Film~More "vague" than "nouvelle", this Rohmeresque wannabe is actually a quintessentially British romantic comedy from the Curtis school. Hugh Bonneville is the fogeyish critic researching for an interview with a French director (Eric Cantona) with celebrated views on l'amour, who comes to question whether he has ever really loved longtime partner Victoria Hamilton. However, it takes the revelation that old pal Douglas Henshall has been unfaithful to girlfriend Anne-Marie Duff for Bonneville to realise where his heart truly lies. Complete with knowingly stylised clips from Cantona's masterpieces and copious cutaways to his pseudo-significant aphorisms, Jackie Oudney's feature debut is as charmingly cine-literate as it is genially enjoyable. But Aschlin Ditta's plot-heavy screenplay fails to develop Bonneville's bourgeois bumbler with any depth, and the movie's surfeit of chatterati caricatures and clichés makes it just a teensy bit smug.~false~29/09/2010~23:25~00:55~90

Revolving around a formidable Oscar-nominated turn by Ben Kingsley, the slow-burning film tells the story of a former Iranian colonel reduced to working menial jobs in the US. Desperate to return his family to the prosperity they once knew, he spends his life's savings on the repossessed home of recovering addict Jennifer Connelly, only to come into tragic confrontation with the woman over the property. Drawing on his own experience as an immigrant, Perelman paints a vivid and moving picture of cultural alienation and desperation. Though the feature occasionally lacks balance, portraying Americans as largely unsympathetic and immigrants as vulnerable, it redeems itself by focusing on the emotional similarities between Kingsley and Connelly's characters. If Connelly looks too well groomed for her tortured role, it certainly doesn't spoil her overall strong performance, while Shohreh Aghdashloo and Jonathan Ahdout are wonderful as Kingsley's wife and son.~false~05/10/2010~23:05~01:10~125

Natural World~3/14~Sea Otters - A Million Dollar Baby~~~~false~false~true~true~true~false~true~false~~~Nature~Sea otters are shy creatures that usually live in quiet, secluded areas of the ocean among the kelp forests. So it's rare for humans to be able to observe them at close quarters for any length of time. Fortuitously for us, one female otter has chosen to give birth and bring up her pup on a jetty in the busy marina of Monterey, California. Sea otters are adorably cute to watch: the mother constantly cuddles the youngster in a remarkably human way and their sleeping position - floating on the backs with their paws in the air - is irresistible. This charming, engrossing film shows her gently teaching her pup to swim and how to use the hard hulls of boats to crack open molluscs so she can eat, but young viewers should be warned there are sad moments too when a bully of a male otter known as Pink Blue attacks the mother, leaving her seriously injured and her pup on her own.

A by-the-numbers exercise that falls flat from the beginning, it's the sort of foppish romp normally associated with Hugh Grant. Here the fumbling Brit is Colin Firth, playing a sensitive English artist who heads to the small US town of Hope to mend his broken heart after he is betrayed by brittle fiancée Minnie Driver. There he finds more than a shoulder to cry on in the shape of free-spirited nurse Heather Graham - a coupling that feels weak and contrived, despite Graham's endearingly perky performance. Firth lacks conviction, trotting out his lines on autopilot, while there's no chemistry between the leads, even during the most intimate sequences. The film simply shambles along, hampered by limp direction.~false~06/10/2010~23:15~00:45~90
